				<h1>Identifying the Problem</h1>
				<p> We discovered the problem by talking to each other and sharing our <b>personal experiences.</b>
					We've discovered that everyone in the team has a group of friends with whom they'd want to go
					hiking,
					but as they started planning, <b>many gave up on the idea.</b> And even though we eventually managed
					to choose a hiking route,
					it turned out that the <b>difficulty level</b> was not a good match for everyone.
					<br>
					<br>
					Moreover, we realized that throughout time we could have avoided <b>endless conversations</b> with
					no real results in
					matters of planning by creating an app that could simplify the whole process: <b
						style="color: #007688">inMontana.</b>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Initial Solution</h1>
				<p> Our first thought was to develop an application that would simplify the process of planning a hiking
					trip by including several
					functionalities. The application would enable its users to find <b>hiking routes suitable to their
						needs</b>, in terms of length,
					difficulty or geographical area, and to also <b>shorten the time needed to organize everything.</b>
					We believe that <b style="color: #007688">inMontana</b> can
					become a way for people to <b>discover nature in a safer and faster manner</b>, so that every trip
					will become a fun adventure.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Customer Discovery</h1>
				<p>The two ways we tried to reach our potential customers are through a shareable <b>Google form</b>,
					and <b>discussions</b>
					with our friends and colleagues about the problem and our possible solution. The Google form was
					shared
					within several groups, to reach out to people with various hobbies, from the ones that do hiking on
					a regular basis,
					to the ones that have always found an excuse to avoid this kind of activity.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>The Whole Process</h1>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 2em;">At first, we started chatting about trekking in Romania with friends and
					colleagues, without implying
					that this was our project proposal. Following these casual discussions, we realized that hiking is a
					hot
					topic among our friends, and that they actually do have issues when it comes to planning such trips.
					Wanting to see if the problem is real, rather than validate our idea, we decided to create <a
						href=https://forms.gle/p6p2hoFZmjbEsQWG6><b>a form</b></a> for a
					larger group of people to fill out. The only thing we thought about at this point was getting the
					form
					to reach as many people as possible.
				</p>
				<div class="w3-content w3-display-container">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form1.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form2.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form3.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form4.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form5.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form6.jpeg">
					<img class="form-img" src="images/form7.JPG">

					<button class="w3-button w3-white w3-display-left" onclick="plusDivs(-1)">&#10094;</button>
					<button class="w3-button w3-white w3-display-right" onclick="plusDivs(1)">&#10095;</button>
				</div>

				<p style="padding-top: 2em;">
					We have mentally prepared for any outcome while waiting for the results (even to change the idea or
					to adapt it). However, many people answered up to this point (91), and the statistics were quite
					encouraging:
				</p>
				<div class="stats">

					<img src="images/cazare.png">
					<img src="images/aplicatii.png">
					<img src="images/functionalitati.png">
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Gained insights </h1>
				<p> We predominantly reached individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 (more than 75 percent of our respondents fall into this category), with the 25-50 age group coming in second. 
					The vast majority of our respondents (more than 78 percent) said they go hiking a few times a year, with limited knowledge of hiking routes, insufficient time for planning, 
					a lack of people to join them, or simply a lack of interest in this hobby being some of the most significant barriers people face when organizing a trip. When asked about the 
					duration of a hiking trip, more than eight out of ten people said they go on one-day hikes. Their answers matched our expectations so far, hinting that the key features of our 
					application would suit their needs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We attempted to estimate how difficult it is for people to plan different aspects of the trip and achieved the following scores out of a possible 5: 3.04 for finding their ideal hiking route, 
					3.18 for finding hiking partners, and 2.55 for finding places to sleep. These figures suggest that the main features of our application should be an optimized route search and a social 
					component for finding others to go on hikes with.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wanted to learn more about what apps people use to plan a hike in order to better understand the entire process, and the results revealed that the most popular apps are those for social
					 media, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as those for maps (Google Maps) and our direct competitor, Muntii nostri. These responses point to the necessity for an app like inMontana 
					 that combines social and trip-planning components.
				</p>

				<p style="padding-bottom: 2em;">Lastly, in addition to the features that we had already intended to incorporate, we discovered that users are really interested in having an application that will make them 
					feel secure (signaling functions for bears and other dangers, SOS button etc.). We also intend to provide challenges and enjoyable activities for our users in order to increase
					 their interest with inMontana.
				</p>
				<img src="images/infographic.png">
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1> Are we ready for the next stage? </h1>
				<p> After analyzing the answers to the form, we concluded that <b>our idea for the</b> <b
						style="color: #007688">inMontana</b> <b>application is viable</b>.
					A high percentage of the people whose opinion we asked for has declared that the main obstacles that
					stand between them and hiking are the lack
					of knowledge and time to organize their trip, and <b style="color: #007688">inMontana</b> <b>is
						ready to help them</b>. Based on the information presented
					we can say that we are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage. </p>

				<p>Before officially launching the landing page, we made a series of changes that are described below: </p>

						<li>
							We decided to go for an interface that is more user-friendly and emphasies the important elements.
						</li>
						<li>
							We added a subscription section that collects e-mail addresses.
						</li>
						<li>
							We realized that the call-to-action "Learn more and start today" button made the navigation process slower so we
						 	decided to add a short description of our application right at the top of the page.
						</li>
						<li>
							We integrated <b>Hotjar</b> and <b>Google Analytics</b>.</p>
						</li>

				<h1>Promoting The Landing Page</h1>
				<p>After finishing the landing page, we started sharing it on <b>Whatsapp</b> and through <b>Facebook</b>,
				to a community of people that are keen on hiking. </p>

				<img style="width: 40%; height: 40%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="images/promote_landing1.png">
				<img style="width: 70%; height: 70%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/promote_landing2.png">

				<br>
				<br>

				Those methods proved to be efficient as many people decided to subscribe to be notified about <b>inMontana's</b> launch:
				<img style="align-items: center" src="images/subscribers.png">
				
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Google Analytics</h1>
				<p>We launched the landing page at the end of November and analyzed the traffic between December 1-6.
					During this period a number of 47 people visited our page, with a peak of 30 on 5th of December, when we
					massively promoted it, with the traffic then gradually decreasing over the previous day from the first 
					moment we shared it, as expected. The avarage session duration was of about 30 seconds, a good and enough time to browse the information.

					<br>
					<img style="align-items: center" src="images/user_traffic.png">
					<br>

					People accessed our page by directly accessing its link shared using mostly Whatsapp.

					<br>
					<img style="align-items: center" src="images/user_provenience.png">
					<br>

					When it comes to location, most traffic comes from Romania, which is expected considering the fact 
					that our application promotes Romanian hiking trails and the groups we shared it to are 
					represented by Romanian communities. We also have a few visits from other countries, which could suggest an
					interest in Romanian tourism.

					<br>
					<img style="align-items: center" src="images/user_countries.png">
					<br>

					As for the devices that were used for reaching our platform, our visitors came from both mobile and web browsers,
					with chrome being the most popular one.

					<img style="align-items: center" src="images/user_device.png">
					<br>

				</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Hotjar</h1>
				<p>We analyzed the heatmap using Hotjar, to see how 
					people interact with our landing page, and also scroll maps to check if they read the entire page.
				
					A public heatmap can be found <b><a href="https://imgur.com/a/hcK8MaN">here</a></b>. At the moment that we draw these conclusions, 
					Hotjar registers 25 sessions with 156 clicks.

					When it comes to the <b>heatmap</b>, the most accessed areas are the home button, followed by the subscribe area, with the 
					rest of the options (features, pricing and contact) closely following them in popularity. This indicates the fact that the
					 visitors are interested in the areas presented in the landing page and easily understand what <b>inMontana</b> has to offer.

				</p>
				
			</div>

			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Conclusions</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>We managed to reach a decent amount of people, however we need to improve our strategy and find more suitable or active groups on which we can share our landing page</li>
					<li>Out of the 47 people who visited our website, we managed to get approx. 30 subscribers, which means that almost 65% of the users we reached are interested in our product</li>
					<li>The average time spent on our landing page was of 30 seconds, which indicates that users can quickly understand what the main idea of our product is, with some even checking the whole page</li>

				<h1>Target Market</h1>
				<p>As our app is built around Romanian mountains, we are focusing on competitors that are directly targeting 
					Romanian public and Romanian tracks.<br>
					Our target market is split between two sub-markets, namely users, people that are passionate about hiking,
					 and partners - people who own accommodation places in Romania, close to popular hiking locations. 
					 We decided to focus solely on Romania, wishing to promote these activities and the places the country has to offer, 
					 targeting people above 16 years old, from anywhere in the country.<br>
					Judging based on the biggest hiking communities on Facebook which have more than 50k members, we consider that 
					there are 60k customers that we target initially. We also analyzed the traffic on our competitors' 
					websites in order to gain more insights on the actual number of customers that may be interested in our product.
					The result of this was an increase of almost 250% of what we thought of the number of customers is.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box-center">
				<h1>Direct Competitors</h1>
				<p>We used two websites that provide data on website similarity
